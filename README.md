## The List of Doing
This application is a basic To-Do list tool that allows users to add a plethora of custom tasks along with their level of priority. By creating a unique username the operator will be able to add to/subtract from a personal list as long as the tasks are all added under the same alias. The actual to-do list can be reached through the link at the bottom of the application page that will send the user to the results page. The List of Doing was created using static positioning HTML along with a JavaScript front end.

## Technical Achievements
- Server-Side Processing: Used Node.js to create an HTTP server that could handle different requests and interact with the file system.
- Client-Server Communication: Client and server communication was acheived allowing data to be sent to the server and then retrieved and updated on the results page.
- Error handling: Built in error handling for server and resource errors (500 & 404).

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
